Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
 I chose to overload  the constructor and enter methods in the House, Library, and Cafe classes because the default constructor is for any kind of cafe,library, or house that allows specification of any number floors, while the methods that I overrode was used to default the buildings as a 1 floor building. I also overloaded the to string method to print out the information of the buildings.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
  I thought I did something wrong with toString() but I found out I had to put in the System.out.println() to make the to string function work. However, my overloaded methods worked as I expected. I would give advice that it is important to analyze code before deciding what to do.
