- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
 I chose to overload  the constructor and enter in Cafe because the default constructor is for any kind of cafe that allows specification of any number floors, while the methods that I overrode was used to default the cafe as a 1 floor building.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
