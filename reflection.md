Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
 I chose to overload  the constructor and enter methods in the House, Library, and Cafe classes because the default constructor is for any kind of cafe,library, or house that allows specification of any number floors, while the methods that I overrode was used to default the buildings as a 1 floor building.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
